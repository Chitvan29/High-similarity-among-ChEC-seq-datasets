High similarity among ChEC-seq datasets
ChEC-seq is a method used to identify protein-DNA interactions across a genome. It involves fusing micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to a protein of interest. In principle, specific genome- wide interactions of the fusion protein with chromatin result in local DNA cleavages that can be mapped by DNA sequencing. ChEC-seq has been used to draw conclusions about broad gene-specificities of certain protein-DNA interactions. In particular, the transcriptional regulators SAGA, TFIID, and Mediator are reported to generally occupy the promoter/UAS of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II in yeast. Here we compare published yeast ChEC-seq data performed with a variety of protein fusions across essentially all genes, and find high similarities with negative controls. We conclude that ChEC-seq patterning for SAGA, TFIID, and Mediator differ little from background at most promoter regions, and thus cannot be used to draw conclusions about broad gene specificity of these factors.
